clcal -- the command line calendar
==================================
The purpose of clcal is to provide a terminal-based on-screen reminder of
appointments, important dates, and other events over a pre-defined range of
days.

I wrote it because I often forget to check my calendar for appointments,
either because I'm too busy (!) to check, or I get sidetracked by e-mails
and telephone calls.  However, I always login!

clcal is not designed to store and display huge amounts of information.  It is
just for brief reminders.


How to install
==============
Compile the source with:

	 make

If all goes well, this will create the clcal binary.

Copy this anywhere you like, preferably somewhere in your $PATH.
(I put it in ~/bin)


How to use
==========
clcal was designed to be run from your shell startup file such as (if you use
bash) ~/.bashrc, but how you use it is up to you.

If you only wish to be reminded once of your appointments, and not each time
you open a new term (I tend to open lots), then put a pre-requisite check in
before you run clcal, e.g.

# check for number of terms, run clcal if only one term is open
# (Eterm is used in this example)
if [ `ps -ef | grep Eterm | grep $LOGNAME | grep -v grep | wc -l | awk '{ print $1 }'` = 1 ]
   then
      ~/bin/clcal -w
fi
# end check

~/.calendar/year/month/date
---------------------------
This directory structure is absolutely required if you wish to make any use of
clcal.  Note the following formats:

~	    refers to your home directory
.calendar   a directory
year	    this directory represents the year in four-digit format, e.g. 2004
month	    this directory represents the month in two-digit format, e.g. 05
date	    this file represents the date in two-digit format, e.g. 09

The date file contains the appointment/event information you wish to display.
Just create and edit this file using your preferred editor.
You are limited to 61 characters per line (how much information do you want to
display fer cryin' out loud?)  Note that tabs may not be accurately echoed
to the screen, so use spaces as a preference.

~/.clcal/colour.cfg
-------------------
The colour.cfg file is optional.  Copy the sample from the source directory
to the location listed if you wish to colour your output.  Edit the file to
suit your requirements.  By default (i.e if you don't have a colour.cfg file),
certain parts of the output are printed in bold.

clcal command line options
--------------------------
-h, --help       Prints the help page.
-v, --version    Prints version information.

-d #, --day #    Prints your calendar entries for # number of days,
                 or one day (today) if no number is specified. Negative
                 numbers are allowed (e.g: -7) to print previous entries.
-w #, --week #   Prints your calendar entries for # number of weeks (etc).
-m #, --month #  Prints your calendar entries for # number of months (etc).
-y #, --year #   Prints your calendar entries for # number of years (etc).

                 The period options above (-d/w/m/y etc) may be combined
                 in positive-negative pairs to display previous calendar
                 entries and future calendar entries with the same command.
                 For example: "clcal -d 7 -w -9" will print calendar
                 entries for nine weeks prior to today, then today's
                 entries, then the entries for the next seven days.
                 "clcal -w -9 -w" will achieve the same output.

-s xyz,         {Performs a search ahead in your calendar entries for the
--search xyz    {regular expression "xyz". The search is case insensitive.
--searchfwd xyz {The default is to search one year ahead, but this can be
                {tailored by combining with the period flags above.
                {e.g: "clcal -s doctor -m" or "clcal -w 7 -s dentist".
                {If your regular expression has spaces in it, put quotes
                {around it, e.g: clcal -s "bank holiday". Negative
                {numbers are allowed (e.g: "clcal -w -7 -s dentist")
                {to search through past entries (like the -b option).

-b abc,         {Performs a search back in your calendar's (past) entries
--searchbck abc {for the regular expression "abc". The search is case
                {insensitive.  The default search period is one year, and
                {may be modified in a similar way to the -s option.
                {Negative numbers are not allowed with an explicit
                {search back (-b or --searchbck).

-a lmn,         {Performs a search through all your calendar's entries
--all lmn       {for the regular expression "lmn". The search is case
                {insensitive.  If the regular expression is omitted, then
                {this option will print ALL your calendar entries to stdout.

The options -b, and --searchbck are potentially deprecated by the introduction
of the use of negative numbers as search modifiers.  After some thought,
I have decided that these options will remain in future versions of clcal.

Running clcal without any options will generate a brief usage message.


Caveats
=======
*  The maximum length for a line in a date file is currently 61 characters.  If
   you go beyond this, strange things happen.
*  If the date file contains tabs, these may not be accurately echoed to the
   screen, so please use spaces if you get unusual results.
*  The --month/-m option actually searches for calendar entries 30 days (or
   multiples of 30 days) ahead, not one calendar month.
*  The output is emboldened/coloured using ANSI escape sequences.  If your term
   cannot interpret these correctly, then I'm afraid clcal (as it is), is not
   for you.
*  This is my first published C program.  Learning all the time.
