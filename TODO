Still to do
===========


Known Bugs
==========

1. Files with lines greater than 61 characters in length mess up the output.
   (Is this beyond the scope of this program?  This is supposed to be for
   short reminders.  Dunno.  I'm personally not that bothered by this.)

To do
=====


0.17  Initial planned features complete.  I'm moving the development status of
      clcal to "beta"  :)


Possible future options
=======================
These are possible future options for clcal.  They are thoughts, musings,
jottings, etc, and may not be implemented.

clcal -x 5
   search and print the next five calendar entries

The option to create an appointment which lasts a number of days.  One
possibility within the existing framework is create a file such as
~/.calendar/2004/10/06.2 with an entry like "Linux Expo, London, Olympia".
clcal would have to read this along with any other files in the directory
such as 06, 06.5, etc.  AND it would have to know to read the file after
the intial date has passed.  Hmm.  It might be easier echoing a line and
redirecting it to several sequential files!
